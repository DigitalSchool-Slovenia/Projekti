            <h1 class="text">Trial chambers are an insanely good addition, espeicaly in early game since it can give you diamonds, iron and a lot of other stuff.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Trials</h1>
            <h1 class="text">When you step into a trial chamber monsters will ussualy spawn from their spawners. They will keep spawning for some time and after you defeat them all you will either get food or trial keys. Trial keys can be used to open vaults containing very good loot. If you drink an omnious (also obtaniable from casual trial vaults) you will start an omnious trial. An omnious trial can give you either very good food or omnious keys. Omnious keys are used to open omnious vaults which are ussualy out of reach. Omnious vaults have a slight chance to contain a heavy core used, to craft a mace.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">The Mace</h1>
            <h1 class="text">The mace is an insane weapon technicaly being able to do an infinite amount of damage. It works by dealing more damage, the higher you fall from. It can do a very big amount of damage when paired together with an item that gets you high-ground.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Loot</h1>
            <h1 class="text">There are a lot of ways to get loot in trial chambers. Aside vaults there are chests that contain loot and sometimes bamboo. And the pots scattered around the trial chamber can also contain loot which you can collect by breaking them.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Early Gane</h1>
            <h1 class="text">Trial chambers are very good in early game since they give a lot of loot like diamonds, iron, enchanted books and in omnious trials even blocks of diamonds and the mace. Crossing upon a trial chamber in the early stages of minecraft.</h1>
