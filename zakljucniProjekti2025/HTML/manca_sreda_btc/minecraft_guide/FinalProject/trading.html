            <h1 class="mainTitle">Trading</h1>
            <h1 class="text">Trading is essential for any world in minecraft. Having the option to be able to trade some sticks<br>for enchanted armor is amazing!</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Jobs</h1>
            <h1 class="text">Diffrent jobs give villagers diffrent items to trade. Some jobs are very usefull meanwhile others aren't as much.<br><br>Here are some of the most usefull jobs that you should have in every world:</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Fletcher</h1>
            <h1 class="text">This villager is arguably the best one. His first trade is 32 sticks for an emerald almost every time. At first it might seem bad but when you realize you can make 4 sticks out of 2 planks, and 4 planks out of 1 log you come to realize you only need 4 logs for 1 emerald. Combining a flethcer with another good villager is really good.<br>In order to get a fletcher a villager must have a fletching table.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Librarian</h1>
            <h1 class="text">This is a very good villager, since it has insanely good trades being able to trade you any kind of enchanted book all the way from protection, to strenght, to mending and other kinds of enchants. Its prices ussualy range from a book and some emeralds based on the enchant he trades you.<br>In order to get a librarian you will need a lectern.</h1>
            <h1 class="title">Armorer, Toolsmith and Weaponsmith</h1>
            <h1 class="text">These 3 jobs are very good and very similar. They all give you gear if its the armorer giving you armor, weaponsmith giving you weaposn such as axes and swords or the toolsmith giving you tools like axes, pickaxes, shovels and hoes. These 3 villagers are very good espeicaly when you don't feel like going mining but still need tools.<br>In order to get an armorer you will need a blast furnace.<br>A toolsmith will require a smithing table.<br>And a weaponsmith needs a grindstone.</h1>
