    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. It is used to style HTML elements on a webpage, controlling the design aspects such as colors, fonts, layouts, and even animations. While HTML provides the structure of a webpage, CSS gives it its appearance, making the content more engaging and visually appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without CSS, a website would appear plain and unstyled. By applying different styles to elements, CSS allows you to create beautiful and functional designs for websites and web applications.

    <h2>Basic CSS Syntax</h2>
    <p>
      CSS rules consist of two parts: the <strong>selector</strong> and the <strong>declaration block</strong>. The selector targets the HTML element, and the declaration block contains the properties and values that style it. Here's the basic syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
selector {
  property: value;
}
    </pre>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <pre>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 2em;
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this example, all <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> elements are selected, and their text color is set to blue, with the font size increased to 2 times the normal size.

    <h2>Ways to Use CSS</h2>
    <p>
      There are three main ways to apply CSS to a webpage:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inline CSS</strong> – Used directly in HTML tags via the <code>style</code> attribute. This method is quick but not recommended for large projects.</li>
      <li><strong>Internal CSS</strong> – Written inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML document. This is useful for styling a single page.</li>
      <li><strong>External CSS</strong> – Linked to a separate .css file, which is the most efficient and scalable way to style multiple pages with the same stylesheet.</li>
    </ul>
