    Description of the game:
  </h2>
  <p>
    Minecraft is a very fun and popular sandbox game made out of blocks. Everything is made out of blocks! It allows players to create and build their own virtual world using blocks. 
    <br>
    Players can explore, gather resources, craft items, and engage in combat with various creatures and other players in a procedurally generated open-world environment.
    <br>
    The game offers a creative mode where players have unlimited resources to build whatever they want, and a survival mode where players must gather resources and fend off enemies to survive.
    <br>
    With its endless possibilities for creativity and exploration, Minecraft has become a beloved game for players of all ages.
