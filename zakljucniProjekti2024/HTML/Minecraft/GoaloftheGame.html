    Goal of the game:
  </h2>
  <p>
    The goal of the game Minecraft is to survive and thrive in a blocky, pixelated world filled with endless possibilities.
    <br>
    Players can gather resources, build structures, craft tools and weapons, explore different biomes, and interact with various creatures and other players. 
    <br>
    There are also various objectives and achievements to complete, like or exploring the Nether. Ultimately, the goal is to be creative, 
    strategic, and adventurous as you navigate the vast world of Minecraft and make it your own.
    <br>
    Defeating the Ender Dragon is the main goal. It drops a lot of experience (xp).
