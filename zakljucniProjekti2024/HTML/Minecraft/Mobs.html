    Mobs:
  </h2>
  <p>
   Mobs in Minecraft are creatures that roam the world and interact with players in various ways. There are peaceful mobs, such as cows, pigs, and sheep, which provide resources like food and materials when killed. <br> There are also hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons, and creepers, which will attack players on sight and pose a threat to their survival.
    <br>
   Mobs can spawn in different biomes, depending on the time of day and other factors. Some mobs only spawn at night, while others are only found in certain environments, like the Nether or the End.<br>
   Players can interact with mobs in a variety of ways, including taming them, breeding them, farming them for resources, or using them for transportation. Mobs can also drop rare items or special loot when killed, making them a valuable source of materials for crafting and building.<br>
   Mobs add an element of danger and excitement to the game, as players must navigate the world carefully to avoid being attacked by hostile mobs while also taking advantage of the resources that peaceful mobs provide.
  
    <br>
   Some hostile mobs are: creeper, skeleton, zombie, enderman, witch, spider, blaze, ghast, wither skeleton, slime.
