	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<br>
<p1>The Island consists of multiple climatic and geological regions. There are five larger mountains in the north and plains in the south. Three large Obelisks form a triangle on the Island.</p1>
<hr>
<h1>The Island Map</h1>
<p1>The Island is a large landmass with several smaller islands surrounding the central island. Resources become more common as one travels farther inland, but so do the dangers. Some areas are higher in temperature while others are lower which can be life threatening.
<br>
On the Island there are two types of weather, rain and fog. When it rains, you will hydrate and can fill your Waterskin Waterskin, Water Jar Water Jar, or Canteen Canteen with rainwater, furthermore crop plots will also increase their water amount. When fog rolls in, it is hard to see very far.</p1>
