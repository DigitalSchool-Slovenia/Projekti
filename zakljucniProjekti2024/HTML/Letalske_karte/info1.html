<h1>SRI LANKA</h1>
Sri Lanka (Sinhala স্রি ল্লাক, Sri Lamka , [ˌɕriːlaŋkaː]; Tamil নিল্লান, Ilankai ) until 1972 Ceylon (since then the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka ), is an island country in the Indian Ocean , 237 km (west coast) east of the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent and has a population of 20.8 million. The shortest distance between India (Kodiyakkarai) and Sri Lanka (Munasal) is 54.8 km.

Due to its location, the island represented a strategic maritime center between South and East Asia from antiquity to modern times. The south and the areas around Anuradhapura are centers of ancient Buddhism , while the north and east are Hindu temple complexes. Today, the country is a multi-religious and multi-ethnic country in which, in addition to Buddhism and Hinduism, Christianity and Islam are important religions. The Sinhalese constitute the majority of the population. Tamils ​​are the largest minority. Other ethnic minorities are Moors, Malays, Burghers and Sri Lankan natives, Veda. [8]

Sri Lanka is known for the production and export of tea (Ceylon), coffee , rubber and coconut oil. The island is a popular tourist destination due to its beauty and rich cultural heritage (such as Ayurveda, a traditional healing art).

Sri Lanka was ruled by various local kingdoms for more than two millennia, until the Portuguese and then the Dutch colonized most of the island in the 16th century. Only the Kandian kingdom in the highlands of the island was able to assert itself against the colonizers. In 1815, the entire country finally became part of the British Empire . During the Second World War, Sri Lanka served the Allies as a strategically important base in the fight against the Japanese Empire . [9] Since the beginning of the twentieth century, efforts for independence have increased. In 1948, after peaceful negotiations, Sri Lanka became independent from the British. Unlike most third countries, there has been a stable and democratic system since independence, although there has still been friction between the majority Sinhalese population and the minority Tamils. Between 1983 and 2009, there was a civil war between Tamil separatists and the dominant Sinhalese central government, which claimed many lives, especially of the civilian population. The human rights crimes of the civil war are still not dealt with independently. Between 2005 and 2015, Mahinda Rajapaksa was the country's president and he ruled in an authoritarian manner. [10] [11] Maithripala Sirisena became president in January 2015, promising to step down from authoritarianism.
