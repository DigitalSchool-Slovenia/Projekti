<h1> MEXSICO</h1>
The United States of Mexico , or Mexico for short ( Spanish : México , officially Estados Unidos Mexicanos ; the alternative spelling Méjico is sometimes used in Spain , but this is highly obsolete in the rest of the Spanish-speaking world) is a coastal state in North America , bordered to the north by The United States of America , to the southeast by Guatemala and Belize , to the west by the Pacific Ocean , and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea .
<h1>HISTORY</h1>
<p>Mexico was the cradle of many developed Indian civilizations , such as the Mayans and Aztecs . The arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century and their conquest of the Aztec state in 1521 marked the beginning of Mexico's colonial era as part of New Spain.

In 1810, Mexico declared independence from Spain , which after a long war led to independence in 1821. After independence, the territory of Mexico gradually shrank at the expense of territories that Mexico either sold to the United States or lost in the Mexican-American War , and account of the independence of the Central American countries . In the 1860s, Mexico was occupied by French forces , who were driven out by opponents led by the Mexican patriot Benito Juárez .

Dissatisfaction with the undemocratic regime led by Porfirio Diaz led to the Mexican Revolution in 1910 . The revolutionary forces defeated the federal army, and internal friction kept the country in turmoil for more than twenty years. After the end of the revolution, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) remained in power until the end of the 20th century.
