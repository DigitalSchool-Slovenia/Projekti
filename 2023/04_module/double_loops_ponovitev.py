Exercise 4

Write a program that prints the multiplication table from 1 to 10. The program should print each line in the format "i x j = k", where i and j are the factors being multiplied, and k is their product. 
For example, the program should print:

1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
...
10 x 8 = 80
10 x 9 = 90
10 x 10 = 100

Example output:
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3
...
10 x 9 = 90
10 x 10 = 100
