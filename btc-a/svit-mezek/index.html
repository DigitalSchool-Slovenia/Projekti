<p> The binding of isaac (By Edmung mcmilland) is a game with a lot of stuff to unlock, here is a guide on how to unlock the important stuff.</p>
	<h1>Game machanics/terminotlogy  Characters         Items           Bosses    </h1>
	<ul> Some base mechanice would includeHealth (normal, soul, black, eternal) Damage (How much damage your attack does), Tears (your fire rate), Luck (Effects a lot of things), Speed (the speed at which you move at), Range (how far your attack travels),Devil and angle rooms (Bonus items if you can reach them), Flight (granted by some items, gives you a lot of advantages)</p>
	<li>>Health: Red hearts are what most characters start with, they are the most common but rather lack luster</p>
